Config file/options to easily swap the database library being used (once abstract interface for ObjectStore class is in place): Right now there is an environment variable 'export' option to do this. eg. export USE_ENV_DB=<db_name>

Distribution agnostic tools install script

Make Makefile easy to use with the options to swap in/out DBs

Config file/options to easily swap the database library being used (once abstract interface for ObjectStore class is in place): Right now there is an environment variable 'export' option to do this. eg. export USE_ENV_DB=<db_name>

Distribution agnostic tools install script

Make Makefile easy to use with the options to swap in/out DBs

Complete Kinetic log support by having the following log messages return correct (instead of demo) values:
   * Get Message
   * Get Temperatures
   * Get Utilizations
